## Brainstorming

### Helicopter, catapult, bottle rocket, balloon, plane, attach it to a bird, throw it

## Project Plan Overview

### We decided to make a bottle rocket. To power the bottle rocket we will use HHO otherwise known as "brown gas". This gas is produced from 
doing electrolysis to water. When ignited this gas combusts and rushes out of whichever spot provides the least resistance. Our idea is to have
this gas propel our rocket into the sky.

# Just Kidding, now we're donig a stomp rocket because it would take too much time to do previous idea.
## New Planning
We have decided to do a stomp rocket because the mechanics are simple and it can be designed efficiently. We are going to use a 2 liter bottle to boost the stomp rocket. Then we will use two half inch PVC pipes with an elbow socket to turn the pipe in an upward direction. We found a model of a 2 liter bottle to PVC connector on thingiverse.com (link below) and 3D printed it (1). To balance the stomp rocket model we added another PVC pipe underneath going in a perpendicular orientation. The final piece we had to design, the piece connected the two PVC pipes together (2).
