# Planning

## Brainstorming

### Helicopter, catapult, bottle rocket, balloon, plane, attach it to a bird, throw it

## Project Plan Overview

### We decided to make a bottle rocket. To power the bottle rocket we will use HHO otherwise known as "brown gas". This gas is produced from 
doing electrolysis to water. When ignited this gas combusts and rushes out of whichever spot provides the least resistance. Our idea is to have
this gas propel our rocket into the sky.

# Just Kidding, now we're donig a stomp rocket because it would take too much time to do previous idea.
